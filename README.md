### Implement Stretch Problems --

- **Persist your data** in `window.localStorage()` hint: you may have to pass your data to a stringifier to get it to live inside the `localStorage()` of the browser. This will cause it to persist past the page refresh.

- **Search Functionality** Add a input bar that allows you to search through your tasks and only show the ones that match the search input.

- **Hosting** Create a [Netlify Account](https://www.netlify.com/) and follow the tutorial on how to host your shiny new todo app on the world wide web.
